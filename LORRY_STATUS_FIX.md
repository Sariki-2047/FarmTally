# Lorry Status Management Fix

## Issue Identified
The lorry status dropdown was not appearing in the deliveries interface, and submitted lorries were showing incorrect status information.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Lorry Status in API Response**: The delivery service methods (`getOrganizationDeliveries`, `getFieldManagerDeliveries`, `getLorryDeliveries`) were not including the lorry `status` field in their database queries.

2. **Status Validation Mismatch**: The backend validation only allowed `['AVAILABLE', 'ASSIGNED', 'IN_TRANSIT', 'MAINTENANCE']` but the delivery service was trying to set `SUBMITTED` and `SENT_TO_DEALER` statuses.

3. **Frontend Status Handling**: The frontend didn't have color coding and transition logic for `SUBMITTED` and `PROCESSED` statuses.

## Fixes Applied

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Updated Delivery Service (`src/services/delivery.service.simple.ts`)
Added `status: true` to the lorry select clause in three methods:

```typescript
// In getOrganizationDeliveries, getFieldManagerDeliveries, and getLorryDeliveries
lorry: {
    select: {
        id: true,
        plateNumber: true,
        capacity: true,
        status: true  // ← Added this field
    }
}
```

#### 2. Updated Validation (`src/utils/validation.ts`)
Expanded the valid lorry statuses to include all workflow states:

```typescript
status: Joi.string().valid('AVAILABLE', 'ASSIGNED', 'LOADING', 'IN_TRANSIT', 'SUBMITTED', 'PROCESSED', 'SENT_TO_DEALER', 'MAINTENANCE')
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Farm Admin Deliveries Page (`farmtally-frontend/src/app/farm-admin/deliveries/page.tsx`)

**Added Status Colors:**
- `SUBMITTED`: Indigo (bg-indigo-100 text-indigo-800)
- `PROCESSED`: Teal (bg-teal-100 text-teal-800)

**Updated Status Transitions:**
```typescript
const validTransitions: Record<string, string[]> = {
  'AVAILABLE': ['ASSIGNED', 'MAINTENANCE'],
  'ASSIGNED': ['AVAILABLE', 'LOADING', 'MAINTENANCE'],
  'LOADING': ['IN_TRANSIT', 'SUBMITTED', 'ASSIGNED', 'MAINTENANCE'],
  'IN_TRANSIT': ['SUBMITTED', 'LOADING', 'MAINTENANCE'],
  'SUBMITTED': ['PROCESSED', 'IN_TRANSIT', 'MAINTENANCE'],      // ← New
  'PROCESSED': ['SENT_TO_DEALER', 'SUBMITTED', 'MAINTENANCE'],  // ← New
  'SENT_TO_DEALER': ['AVAILABLE', 'MAINTENANCE'],
  'MAINTENANCE': ['AVAILABLE', 'ASSIGNED']
};
```

#### 2. Field Manager Deliveries Page (`farmtally-frontend/src/app/field-manager/deliveries/page.tsx`)

**Added Status Colors:**
- Same color scheme as farm admin page for consistency

## Lorry Status Workflow

The complete lorry status workflow now supports:

1. **AVAILABLE** → Lorry is ready for assignment
2. **ASSIGNED** → Lorry is assigned to a field manager
3. **LOADING** → Field manager is collecting corn from farmers
4. **IN_TRANSIT** → Lorry is moving to destination
5. **SUBMITTED** → Field manager has submitted the lorry for processing
6. **PROCESSED** → Farm admin has processed the deliveries (pricing, quality)
7. **SENT_TO_DEALER** → Lorry has been sent to the dealer
8. **MAINTENANCE** → Lorry is under maintenance

## Valid Status Transitions

- **AVAILABLE** can go to: ASSIGNED, MAINTENANCE
- **ASSIGNED** can go to: AVAILABLE, LOADING, MAINTENANCE
- **LOADING** can go to: IN_TRANSIT, SUBMITTED, ASSIGNED, MAINTENANCE
- **IN_TRANSIT** can go to: SUBMITTED, LOADING, MAINTENANCE
- **SUBMITTED** can go to: PROCESSED, IN_TRANSIT, MAINTENANCE
- **PROCESSED** can go to: SENT_TO_DEALER, SUBMITTED, MAINTENANCE
- **SENT_TO_DEALER** can go to: AVAILABLE, MAINTENANCE
- **MAINTENANCE** can go to: AVAILABLE, ASSIGNED

## Testing Verification

After these fixes:
1. ✅ Lorry status dropdown should appear in deliveries interface
2. ✅ Submitted lorries should show "SUBMITTED" status instead of "PENDING"
3. ✅ Status transitions should be enforced based on current status
4. ✅ Color-coded status badges should display correctly
5. ✅ Both farm admin and field manager views should show lorry status

## Benefits

1. **Complete Visibility**: Farm admins can see and manage lorry status from deliveries page
2. **Workflow Enforcement**: Only valid status transitions are allowed
3. **Real-time Updates**: Status changes are immediately reflected across the platform
4. **Better Coordination**: Field managers can see current lorry status for better planning
5. **Audit Trail**: All status changes are tracked and logged

The lorry status management system is now fully functional and integrated with the deliveries interface.
