# üöÄ Jenkins Incremental Deployment Plan - FarmTally

## üéØ **4 Focus Areas for Incremental Results**

Each deployment will show **immediate visible progress** that you can test and validate before moving to the next area.

---

## üìã **Area 1: Database & API Foundation** 
### **Goal**: Get real data flowing through your API endpoints

#### **What You'll Deploy:**
```bash
# Backend Changes
- Prisma schema setup
- Database connection
- Basic CRUD endpoints
- Data validation

# Endpoints to Add:
POST /api/users          # Create users
GET  /api/users          # List users  
POST /api/organizations  # Create organizations
GET  /api/organizations  # List organizations
GET  /api/health/db      # Database health check
```

#### **Immediate Results You'll See:**
- ‚úÖ **Real data** in API responses (not mock data)
- ‚úÖ **Database connectivity** confirmed via health endpoint
- ‚úÖ **User creation** working through API
- ‚úÖ **Organization management** functional

#### **Test Commands:**
```bash
# Test database connection
curl http://147.93.153.247:8082/api/health/db

# Create a user
curl -X POST http://147.93.153.247:8082/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com"}'

# List users
curl http://147.93.153.247:8082/api/users
```

#### **Jenkins Deployment Steps:**
1. Update `src/server.simple.ts` with database endpoints
2. Add Prisma configuration
3. Commit & push to trigger Jenkins
4. Verify deployment via health checks
