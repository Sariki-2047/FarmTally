# ✅ SUPABASE CLEANUP COMPLETE!

## 🎯 **ISSUE RESOLVED**

The frontend was still showing "Supabase backend" references even though we had successfully integrated with microservices. All Supabase references have now been cleaned up and replaced with proper microservices terminology.

### **2. Simple Login Test Updated**

### **3. Debug Environment Page Updated**
