# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Authentication System is the foundational security layer for FarmTally that manages user access, multi-tenant organization isolation, and role-based permissions. This system must support three distinct user roles (Farm Admin, Field Manager, Farmer) across multiple organizations while ensuring complete data isolation and secure access control. The system needs to handle user registration, login, password management, and session management with JWT tokens and refresh token rotation for enhanced security.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Farm Admin, I want to register my organization and create my admin account, so that I can start using FarmTally to manage my corn procurement operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new Farm Admin visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL display organization setup and admin account creation forms
2. WHEN the Farm Admin submits valid organization details (name, address, contact info) and admin credentials THEN the system SHALL create a new organization and admin user account
3. WHEN the organization is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique organization ID for data isolation
4. WHEN the admin account is created THEN the system SHALL send an email verification link to the provided email address
5. IF the email address is already registered THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent duplicate registration
6. WHEN the admin completes email verification THEN the system SHALL activate the account and redirect to the dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Farm Admin, I want to invite Field Managers and add Farmers to my organization, so that I can build my team and supplier network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Farm Admin accesses the user management section THEN the system SHALL display options to invite Field Managers and add Farmers
2. WHEN the Farm Admin sends a Field Manager invitation with email and role details THEN the system SHALL send an invitation email with a secure registration link
3. WHEN a Field Manager clicks the invitation link THEN the system SHALL display a registration form pre-filled with organization and role information
4. WHEN the Field Manager completes registration THEN the system SHALL create their account with appropriate permissions within the organization
5. WHEN the Farm Admin adds a Farmer THEN the system SHALL create a Farmer profile that can be associated with multiple organizations
6. IF a Farmer already exists in the system THEN the system SHALL create an organization association without duplicating the farmer record

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of any role, I want to securely log in to the system, so that I can access my role-specific features and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters valid credentials (email/password) THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and generate JWT access and refresh tokens
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to their role-specific dashboard
3. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent access
4. WHEN a user account is locked due to multiple failed attempts THEN the system SHALL prevent login and require password reset
5. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the access token using the refresh token
6. IF the refresh token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the login page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reset my password when I forget it, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" and enters their email THEN the system SHALL send a password reset link to the registered email
2. WHEN the user clicks the password reset link THEN the system SHALL display a secure password reset form
3. WHEN the user submits a new password meeting security requirements THEN the system SHALL update the password and invalidate all existing sessions
4. WHEN the password is successfully reset THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation email and redirect to login
5. IF the reset link is expired or invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error and offer to send a new reset link
6. WHEN a password reset is completed THEN the system SHALL log the security event for audit purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Farmer, I want to be associated with multiple organizations, so that I can supply corn to different businesses while maintaining separate relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Farmer is added to a new organization THEN the system SHALL create an organization-farmer relationship without affecting existing relationships
2. WHEN a Farmer logs in THEN the system SHALL display all organizations they are associated with
3. WHEN a Farmer selects an organization context THEN the system SHALL show only data relevant to that organization
4. WHEN a Farmer switches between organizations THEN the system SHALL maintain complete data isolation between organizations
5. IF a Farmer is removed from an organization THEN the system SHALL revoke access to that organization's data while preserving other relationships
6. WHEN a Farmer views their profile THEN the system SHALL show organization-specific information for the current context

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want role-based access control enforced at all levels, so that users can only access features and data appropriate to their role and organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL verify the user's JWT token and extract role and organization information
2. WHEN a user attempts to access a resource THEN the system SHALL check if their role has permission for that action within their organization
3. WHEN a Farm Admin accesses data THEN the system SHALL only show data from their organization
4. WHEN a Field Manager accesses features THEN the system SHALL restrict access to manager-level functions within their organization
5. WHEN a Farmer accesses the system THEN the system SHALL show only their own data within the selected organization context
6. IF a user attempts unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and return an appropriate error response

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious system, I want to implement comprehensive session management and security measures, so that user accounts and organizational data remain protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL generate a short-lived JWT access token (15 minutes) and a longer-lived refresh token (7 days)
2. WHEN an access token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to refresh it using the refresh token
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate both access and refresh tokens
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL lock the account and require additional verification
5. WHEN a user changes their password THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing sessions and require re-authentication
6. WHEN multiple failed login attempts occur THEN the system SHALL implement progressive delays and account lockout
7. WHEN any security event occurs THEN the system SHALL log the event with timestamp, user, and action details for audit purposes
