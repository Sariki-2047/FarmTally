## 📊 **Current Area 1 Status:**

### **✅ Working (Foundation Complete):**
- ✅ **Frontend accessible** - Port 8081 ✅
- ✅ **Backend responding** - Port 8082 ✅
- ✅ **Health checks passing** - `/health` ✅
- ✅ **API structure ready** - `/api` ✅
- ✅ **Infrastructure solid** - All containers running ✅

### **🎯 Area 1 Targets (In Progress):**
- 🎯 **Database health endpoint** - `/api/health/db`
- 🎯 **Users CRUD endpoints** - `/api/users`
- 🎯 **Organizations CRUD** - `/api/organizations`
- 🎯 **Enhanced API responses** - Show Area 1 structure

## 🎉 **Success Indicators:**

### **Current Success (Foundation):**
When you test in browser, you should see:
- ✅ Frontend loads without errors
- ✅ Backend health check returns JSON
- ✅ API endpoint responds with success status
- ✅ No connection timeouts or server errors

### **Area 1 Complete Success (Target):**
When Area 1 is fully deployed, you should see:
- ✅ All above working PLUS
- ✅ `/api` shows "Area 1 - Database Ready"
- ✅ `/api/health/db` returns database status
- ✅ `/api/users` returns user data
- ✅ `/api/organizations` returns organization data

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If Frontend (8081) Doesn't Load:**
- Check if URL is exactly: `http://147.93.153.247:8081`
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if your internet connection is working

### **If Backend (8082) Doesn't Respond:**
- Check if URL is exactly: `http://147.93.153.247:8082/health`
- Try the basic API: `http://147.93.153.247:8082/api`
- Wait 30 seconds and try again (container might be restarting)

### **If You See 404 Errors:**
- ✅ **Normal for Area 1 endpoints** - They're not deployed yet
- ❌ **Problem if basic endpoints fail** - `/health` and `/api` should work
