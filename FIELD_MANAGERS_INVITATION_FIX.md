# Field Managers Invitation Display Fix

## Issue Fixed
Field managers invitations were not showing up on the dashboard after being invited. The field managers page was showing a placeholder instead of fetching actual data from the backend.

## Root Cause
1. **Field Managers Page**: The `fetchFieldManagers()` function was not actually calling the API - it was just setting an empty array as a placeholder.
2. **Dashboard Display**: The dashboard was fetching data but not properly displaying both active field managers and pending invitations.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Field Managers API Call
**File**: `farmtally-frontend/src/app/farm-admin/field-managers/page.tsx`

- Updated `fetchFieldManagers()` to actually call `apiClient.getFieldManagers()`
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Now fetches both field managers and invitations

### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Display
**File**: `farmtally-frontend/src/app/farm-admin/page.tsx`

- Updated the Field Managers card to show both active managers and pending invitations
- Added visual indicators (icons and colors) to distinguish between active and pending
- Shows proper counts in the stats cards

### 3. Improved Field Managers Page
**File**: `farmtally-frontend/src/app/farm-admin/field-managers/page.tsx`

- Now displays both active field managers and pending invitations in a unified table
- Added visual indicators:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green icon for active field managers
  - ðŸ“§ Yellow icon for pending invitations
- Shows invitation details including sent date and expiry date
- Added action buttons for resending and canceling invitations

## Features Now Working
