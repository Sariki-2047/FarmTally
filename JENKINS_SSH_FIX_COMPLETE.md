# Jenkins SSH Issue - Complete Fix

## Issue Summary
Jenkins pipeline failed with: `No such DSL method 'sshagent' found`

## Root Cause
The SSH Agent plugin is not installed in the Jenkins instance.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Jenkinsfile
- Replaced `sshagent` with `withCredentials`
- Uses `sshUserPrivateKey` credential type
- More compatible with standard Jenkins installations

### 2. Created Alternative Jenkinsfile
- `Jenkinsfile.no-ssh` for environments without SSH plugins
- Creates deployment packages for manual deployment
- Fallback option if SSH issues persist

### 3. Added Testing Scripts
- `test-jenkins-credentials.sh` for credential verification
- `fix-jenkins-ssh-issue.md` with detailed troubleshooting

## 🚀 Immediate Actions

### Try the Pipeline Again
The main `Jenkinsfile` has been fixed. Simply trigger a new build:

1. Go to Jenkins → FarmTally job
2. Click "Build Now"
3. The pipeline should now work with proper SSH credentials

### If SSH Issues Persist

#### Option A: Install SSH Agent Plugin
```bash
# In Jenkins UI:
# Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins → Available
# Search: "SSH Agent Plugin"
# Install and restart Jenkins
```

#### Option B: Use No-SSH Deployment
```bash
# Replace Jenkinsfile with no-SSH version
cp Jenkinsfile.no-ssh Jenkinsfile
git add Jenkinsfile
git commit -m "Use no-SSH deployment method"
git push origin main
```

## 🔧 Credential Setup Verification

Ensure Jenkins has the SSH credential configured:

1. **Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Manage Credentials**
2. **Look for credential ID: `farmtally-vps-ssh`**
3. **Should be type: "SSH Username with private key"**
4. **Username: `root`**
5. **Private Key: [Your VPS SSH private key]**

## 📋 Expected Pipeline Flow

After fix, the pipeline should:

```
✅ Checkout - Pull latest code from GitHub
✅ Build Frontend - Prepare for VPS build
✅ Prepare Deployment - Verify all files present
✅ Deploy to VPS - Copy files and deploy via SSH
✅ Health Check - Verify services are running
```

## 🌐 Access After Successful Deployment

- **FarmTally App**: http://147.93.153.247:8085/farmtally/
- **Health Check**: http://147.93.153.247:8085/health
- **Default Login**: admin@farmtally.com / Admin123!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If deployment still fails:

1. **Check SSH connectivity**:
   ```bash
   ssh root@147.93.153.247 "echo 'Connection test'"
   ```

2. **Verify VPS has required tools**:
   ```bash
   ssh root@147.93.153.247 "docker --version && docker-compose --version && npm --version"
   ```

3. **Check VPS disk space**:
   ```bash
   ssh root@147.93.153.247 "df -h"
   ```

4. **Manual deployment fallback**:
   - Download deployment package from Jenkins artifacts
   - Upload to VPS manually
   - Run deployment script

## 📞 Support

If issues persist:
1. Check Jenkins console output for specific errors
2. Verify VPS accessibility and credentials
3. Consider using the no-SSH deployment method as fallback
4. Review the troubleshooting guide in `fix-jenkins-ssh-issue.md`
