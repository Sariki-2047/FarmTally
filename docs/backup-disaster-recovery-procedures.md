        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "ERROR: Database backup failed"
    exit 1
fi

# Clean up old local backups
find $BACKUP_DIR -name "farmtally_db_*.sql.gz" -mtime +$RETENTION_DAYS -delete

# Log backup completion
echo "$(date): Database backup completed - $BACKUP_FILE" >> /var/log/farmtally-backup.log

echo "Backup process completed successfully"
```

GIT_COMMIT=$(cd $APP_DIR && git rev-parse HEAD)
BACKUP_FILE="farmtally_app_${TIMESTAMP}_${GIT_COMMIT:0:8}.tar.gz"
BACKUP_PATH="${BACKUP_DIR}/${BACKUP_FILE}"

echo "Starting application backup: $BACKUP_FILE"

# Create application backup
tar -czf $BACKUP_PATH \
  --exclude='node_modules' \
  --exclude='.git' \
  --exclude='logs' \
  --exclude='tmp' \
  -C /opt/farmtally current/

**Recovery Steps**:

1. **Assess Damage**
   ```bash
   # Check database status
   sudo systemctl status postgresql
   
   # Attempt connection
   psql farmtally_production -c "SELECT 1;"
   
   # Check for corruption
   psql farmtally_production -c "SELECT pg_database_size('farmtally_production');"
   ```

2. **Stop Application**
   ```bash
   # Stop application to prevent further damage
   pm2 stop farmtally
   
   # Verify application is stopped
   pm2 status
   ```

3. **Restore Database**
