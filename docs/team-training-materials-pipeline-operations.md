    A[Git Push] --> B[Jenkins Trigger]
    B --> C[Workspace Setup]
    C --> D[Environment Injection]
    D --> E[Backend Build]
    D --> F[Frontend Build]

    J --> L[Rollback on Failure]
```

**Pipeline Stages Explained**
1. **Workspace Setup**: Validates repository structure and paths
2. **Environment Injection**: Loads secure credentials from Jenkins vault
3. **Backend Build**: Compiles TypeScript and creates production bundle
4. **Frontend Build**: Builds Next.js application with production configuration
5. **Database Migration**: Applies Prisma schema changes
6. **Deployment**: Uploads artifacts and restarts services
7. **Health Checks**: Verifies application functionality
8. **Artifact Storage**: Archives build for rollback capability

#### Hands-on Exercise 1.1
```bash
# Exercise: Explore Pipeline Structure
1. Access Jenkins dashboard
2. Navigate to FarmTally-Pipeline job
3. Review last 5 builds and their stages
4. Identify which stages took longest
5. Note any failed builds and their failure points

# Questions to answer:
- What is the average build duration?
- Which stage fails most frequently?
- How can you tell if a build was successful?
```

### Module 1.2: Triggering and Monitoring Builds (45 minutes)

#### Learning Objectives

4. Notify team of manual deployment
5. Monitor build progress actively
```

**Build Monitoring Best Practices**
- Always watch console output during manual builds
- Check each stage completion before moving to next
- Monitor system resources during builds
- Verify health checks pass before considering success

**Reading Build Logs**
```bash
# Key log sections to monitor:
1. Environment variable injection
2. Dependency installation output
3. Build compilation messages
4. Test execution results
5. Deployment status messages
6. Health check responses
```

#### Hands-on Exercise 1.2

4. Monitor console output in real-time
5. Identify each stage transition
6. Note any warnings or errors
7. Verify successful completion

# Assessment Questions:
