Developers work on separate domains (lorry ops, farmer mgmt, UI foundation) with regular integration points.

### Weeks 11-16: Interface Development Phase
Each developer owns a complete user role interface, ensuring deep understanding and ownership.

### Weeks 17-21: Integration & Polish Phase
Focus shifts to integration, optimization, and advanced features with cross-developer collaboration.

### Weeks 22-25: Production Readiness Phase
Final testing, performance optimization, and deployment preparation with all developers contributing to quality assurance.
