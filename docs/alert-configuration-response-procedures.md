## Response Procedures

### Critical Alert Response (P0)

#### Immediate Actions (0-5 minutes)

1. **Acknowledge Alert**
   ```bash
   # Acknowledge in Slack
   /alert ack <alert_id> "Investigating"
   
   # Or via Alertmanager API
   curl -X POST http://alertmanager:9093/api/v1/alerts \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"status": "acknowledged"}'
   ```

2. **Initial Assessment**
   - Check application status: `curl -f https://farmtally.com/api/health`
   - Review recent deployments in Jenkins
   - Check system resources on production servers

3. **Immediate Mitigation**
   ```bash
   # If application is down, attempt restart
   ssh farmtally@prod-server
   pm2 restart farmtally
   
   # If deployment failed, consider rollback
   # Trigger rollback job in Jenkins
   ```

#### Investigation Phase (5-15 minutes)

1. **Gather Information**
   ```bash
   # Check application logs
   pm2 logs farmtally --lines 100
   
   # Check system logs
   journalctl -u farmtally -f --since "10 minutes ago"
   
   # Check database status
   psql farmtally_production -c "SELECT 1;"
   ```

2. **Identify Root Cause**
   - Review error patterns in logs
   - Check for recent configuration changes
   - Verify external service dependencies

3. **Implement Fix**
   - Apply immediate fix if identified
   - Rollback if recent deployment caused issue
   - Scale resources if capacity issue

#### Communication (Throughout)

1. **Status Updates**
   ```
   Initial: "Investigating critical alert: [brief description]"
   Progress: "Root cause identified: [cause]. Implementing fix: [action]"
   Resolution: "Issue resolved. Monitoring for stability."
   ```

2. **Stakeholder Notification**
   - Notify product team if user-facing impact
   - Update status page if external users affected
   - Inform management for extended outages

   - Monitor for improvement
   - Document actions taken

### Medium Alert Response (P2)

#### Response Timeline (1 hour)

1. **Triage** (0-15 minutes)
   - Assess impact and urgency
   - Determine if immediate action needed
   - Schedule investigation if non-urgent

2. **Investigation** (15-45 minutes)
   - Detailed analysis of issue
