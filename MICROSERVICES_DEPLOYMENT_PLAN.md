## Deployment Architecture

```
Internet → Nginx (80/443) → API Gateway (8080) → Individual Services (8081-8088)
                                ↓
                         PostgreSQL Database (5432)
```

## Benefits
1. **Independent Deployment**: Deploy/update services individually
2. **Scalability**: Scale high-traffic services independently
3. **Testing**: Test services in isolation
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Service failures don't bring down entire system
5. **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use different tech stacks
6. **Team Organization**: Teams can own specific services

## Implementation Steps
1. Create service-specific Docker containers
2. Set up service discovery and communication
3. Configure API Gateway routing
4. Implement health checks for each service
5. Set up monitoring and logging
6. Create deployment scripts for each service
